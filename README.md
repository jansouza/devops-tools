# Devops Tools

Welcome to our Docker repository designed to streamline DevOps workflows. 
This Docker image contains essential tools for devops.

## Key Features:

- **Pre-installed Git:** Git is already configured in this image, making it easy to manage version control of your projects directly from your Docker environment.

- **Included Kubectl:** Kubectl is readily available in this image, enabling you to efficiently manage and interact with your Kubernetes clusters.

- **Included Sonar Scanner:** The SonarScanner CLI is the scanner to use when there is no specific scanner for your build system.

- **Included Trivy:** Trivy is the most popular open source security scanner, reliable, fast, and easy to use.

- **Included Gitleaks:** Gitleaks is a SAST tool for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git repos. Gitleaks is an easy-to-use, all-in-one solution for detecting secrets, past or present, in your code.

- **Included Skopeo:** Skopeo is a tool for manipulating, inspecting, signing, and transferring container images and image repositories on LinuxÂ® systems, Windows and MacOS. Like Podman and Buildah, Skopeo is an open source community-driven project that does not require running a container daemon..

- **Ready for DevOps:** With all essential tools already included, you can quickly set up a complete DevOps environment to develop, test, and deploy your applications.
